    "# Python Modules: Organizing Code into Reusable Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. It can define functions, classes, and variables. Modules help organize your code into reusable parts. Think of them as separate compartments in a toolbox, each containing a set of tools that you can use in your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Simple Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple module **SimpleFinance.py** in which we define a class (`BankAccount`) and two functions: `transfer_funds` and `total_balance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `transfer_funds` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `transfer_funds` function takes two `BankAccount` instances, a sender, and a receiver, along with the transfer amount. It checks if the sender has sufficient balance and performs the transfer if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `total_balance` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `total_balance` function takes a list of `BankAccount` instances and calculates the total balance by summing up the balances of all accounts in the list.\n"

It's worth noting that if a module is in the same directory as the script or notebook you're working on, it can be imported directly by name. As we did in this file. However, if it is not in the same working directory, we must take different steps, as we will discuss later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it is important to realze the keyword \"as\" in \"import SimpleFinance as SM\". The as keyword in Python is used in import statements to create an alias for an imported module. This means you can refer to the module using a different name (usually a shorter one) for the rest of your script or notebook. This practice is common for modules that are frequently used or have longer names."
